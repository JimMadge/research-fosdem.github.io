# Code of Conduct

The Open Research devroom is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion (or lack thereof), sexual identity and orientation, or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form – both online and at the in-person event. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the Open Research devroom at the discretion of the organisers.
