# Code of Conduct
Thank you for joining us at the FOSDEM Open Research devroom.

We ask that all participants adhere to this Code of Conduct in both our virtual conference, as well as in person devroom, in addition to the [Code of Conduct](https://fosdem.org/2024/practical/conduct/) of the wider FOSDEM conference.

# Standards
The Open Research devroom team is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone.

This means that the organisers are commited to facilitating an open and inclusive environment for all participants, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion (or lack thereof), sexual identity and orientation, or technology choices. 

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all devroom participants:

- Be respectful and value each other’s ideas, styles and viewpoints.
- Be considerate of others' participation, including use of conference time
- Be inclusive and help new perspectives be heard
- Be open to learning from others
- Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Please alert the devroom organisers if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

As an overriding general rule, please be intentional in your actions and humble in your mistakes.

We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form – both online and at the in-person event. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter, Mastodon and other online media. 

Unacceptable behaviors include the following:
- Intimidating, harassing, lewd, demeaning, bullying, stalking, trolling or threatening speech or actions
- Unwelcome sexual attention or physical contact
- Any real or implied threat of physical harm
- Sustained disruption of speakers or events (verbally or physically)
- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Advocating or encouraging any of the above behaviors

For more information and examples about what constitutes harassment, please refer to OpenCon’s Code of Conduct in Brief and the [Gathering for Open Source Hardware’s](https://openhardware.science/gosh-2017/gosh-code-of-conduct/) examples of behaviour.

Conference participants violating these rules may be asked to leave or removed from the Open Research devroom (virtual or in-person) at the discretion of the organisers. 

# Enforcement 
Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the online or in-person conference room. 

The organising team may take action to redress anything designed to disrupt, or with the clear impact of disrupting, the event or making the environment hostile for any participants.

# Reporting
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the devroom organising team immediately. 

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may also be reported to the organisers responsible for enforcement at [anonymous Google form?]

All complaints will be considered, reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly by the conference organisers, who will collectively decide on appropriate action. All devroom organisers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

# Recusal
Conference organisers and any others responsible for enacting or overseeing this policy will recuse themselves if they have a significant conflict of interest, such as being a specific target of harassment, an alleged harasser, or having a close personal or professional relationship with a target or alleged harasser.
