# Join us at FOSDEM 2022
## <span style="background-color:hsl(347, 90%, 96%); color:hsl(348, 100%, 61%);">Note: the devroom has been proposed, but not accepted yet :)</span>

We invite **developers or users of open tools and technologies** used in a research context to contribute to the [FOSDEM 2022](https://fosdem.org/2022/) conference.
We understand research as the general process of inquiry and knowledge production such as **scientific research, investigative journalism, NGOs fieldwork**, etc.

We seek talks about:
- **New releases of open source software** of research tools or technologies.
- Feedback on **open technology stacks used** in research contexts (e.g., scientific research, journalistic inquiry, archive creation or publication, etc.) which collect, analyse, document, visualize, and/or share data.
- **Tool design and implementation** for specific research contexts, e.g. how to hold an algorithm accountable to social scientists, how to foster better reproducibility, replicability, repeatability, and interoperability thanks to FLOSS, how to cope with biases of a chart for a data journalist, etc.
- Issues and opportunities about **bridging tech culture with research environments** (research labs, libraries, newsrooms, museums, hackerspaces, makers labs etc.) including community building, organizational, legal and financial aspects.

*Any subjects related to open source technologies in research contexts are welcome even if not in this list.*

Talks will last around *20-40 minutes + 5-10 minutes Q&A*, have to be *in English*.  
The video of the talk has to be pre-recorded in January 2021. The Q/A session will be live.  
The video will be published under Creative Commons CC-BY licence on the [FOSDEM video recordings archive](https://video.fosdem.org/).

# HOW TO SUBMIT

**Wait for the moment! We will open the call when the devroom is officially accepted.**

Submissions must include:
- Abstract
- Session type *(Lecture or Lightning Talk)*
- Expected prior knowledge / intended audience
- Speaker bio
- Links to code / slides / material for the talk *(optional)*
- Links to previous talks by the speaker *(optional)*

Submission process is managed in the Pentabarf system used by the FOSDEM conference.


# The Open Research Technologies devroom

The Open Research Technologies devroom addresses [FLOSS](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.en.html) developers in a broad community concerned with research production and curation: scientists, engineers, journalists, archivists, curators, activists.
The tools and technologies targeted are typically creating, handling or sharing knowledge artifacts: data, academic papers, books, collections, web contents, algorithms, artworks.
This devroom provides a place and time to discuss the issues related to the creation and usage of open research technologies, with the ambition to foster discussions between designers, developers and users, bridging multiple knowledge-based communities together, and with the broader FLOSS community.

The Open Research Technologies devroom aims to:
- Allow knowledge-based tool developers to publicize their effort and become aware of other FLOSS projects.
- Facilitate the pooling of coding efforts on (often poorly funded) tools.
- Create a network where otherwise isolated developers, research engineers can share common FLOSS concerns.
- Provide social recognition for people who work in fields where designing and developing tools is less considered than usual outcomes (e.g. not publishing papers in research, not writing investigation in data journalism, etc).

# What is FOSDEM?

The FOSDEM (Free and Open source Software Developers' European Meeting) is a non-commercial, volunteer-organized European event centered on free and open-source software development. It is aimed at developers and anyone interested in the free and open-source software movement. It aims to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open-source software.
