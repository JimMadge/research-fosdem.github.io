# Abstract of Talks
## MolerHealth: An Open Source Electronic Health Record System
**Abstract:**
In Nigeria, Many healthcare institutions rely on traditional, paper-based methods. This fragmented approach often means that when patients move or visit a different hospital, their comprehensive health history isn't readily available and In critical situations, this lack of immediate access to previous health records can have severe implications, including misdiagnosis or delayed treatments, sometimes even resulting in avoidable loss of life. Our project, MolerHealth, aims to address this significant gap. We're developing a centralized platform to store these vital health records. The vision is for this platform to serve as a comprehensive repository accessible by both hospitals and individual patients.This innovative web application not only consolidates patient data but also utilizes machine learning and artificial intelligence, to anticipate potential health issues. By providing early warnings and data-driven recommendations, MolerHealth enables both patients and healthcare providers to take proactive steps in healthcare management. As an open-source platform, MolerHealth encourages community participation, allowing for continuous improvement and adaptation to the specific healthcare needs of various regions within Nigeria. This approach promises to enhance healthcare efficiency and facilitate more informed decision-making, potentially mitigating the health crises caused by inadequate data management.

**Description:** The Molerhealth project is an initiative aimed at transforming healthcare in Nigeria through the development of an open-source electronic health records (EHR) application. The goal is to address the critical issue of disease misdiagnosis by enabling better information sharing and collaboration between healthcare providers, leading to improved patient outcomes and a more efficient healthcare system. Molerhealth will provide individuals with a secure and user-friendly platform to access, update, and share their comprehensive health records, regardless of their location or healthcare provider. Through this comprehensive EHR system, patients will have seamless continuity of care, as their medical history, test results,medications, allergies and treatment plans will be readily available to healthcare professionals. By harnessing the power of technology, Molerhealth will significantly reduce the rate of misdiagnoses in Nigeria. Doctors will have access to a complete and up-to-date patient profile, enabling accurate diagnoses, appropriate treatment decisions, and timely referrals to specialists when necessary. Moreover, Molerhealth will facilitate better communication between healthcare providers by providing a platform for secure messaging and consultation, enabling the exchange of vital patient information. This collaboration will lead to more informed decision-making, increased efficiency, and ultimately, improved healthcare outcomes. Through its open-source nature, Molerhealth will encourage community participation, innovation, and customization, making it adaptable to the unique healthcare needs of different regions in Nigeria. It will,serve as a catalyst for positive change, empowering individuals, and strengthening the healthcare ecosystem as a whole.

## Fostering Diversity and Sustainability in the Open Source Scientific Software Community: The rOpenSci Champions Program.
**Abstract:**
Research software plays a crucial role in advancing knowledge and innovation, and its development should be inclusive and representative of the diverse communities it serves. Unfortunately, the R and research software communities face a lack of diversity, with developers predominantly being white, male, and from a limited number of countries. This lack of inclusivity raises concerns about the long-term sustainability and utility of projects. In response to this challenge, the rOpenSci Champions Program specifically targets individuals from underrepresented groups who are keen on contributing to rOpenSci and the broader open science ecosystem. In this talk, we will share the motivations behind the creation of the rOpenSci Champions Program, exploring its goals, structure, and the opportunities it provides for participants. We will share insights gained from the implementation of the program's pilot phase, highlighting key outcomes, success stories, and lessons learned. Attendees will gain a deeper understanding of the strategies employed to foster a more inclusive and diverse developer community in the R ecosystem. By showcasing the rOpenSci Champions Program, this talk aims to inspire similar initiatives across the open source landscape and contribute to the ongoing dialogue on enhancing diversity, sustainability, and collaboration in research software development.

## From the Inside Out: Organizational Impact on Open-Source Communities and Contributor Diversity.
**Abstract:**
The involvement of companies and public institutions in open-source software (OSS) has become widespread. While studies have explored the business models of for-profit organizations and their impact on software quality, little is known about their influence on OSS communities, especially in terms of diversity and inclusion. This knowledge gap is significant, considering that many organizations have the resources to enhance diversity and inclusion internally, but whether these efforts extend to OSS remains uncertain. To address this gap, we conducted interviews with maintainers of community-owned and organization-owned OSS projects, revealing tensions between organizations and their projects and identifying the impact of internal policies on OSS communities. Our findings offer insights into how organizations can contribute to improving diversity and inclusion in their open-source projects and, consequently, in the wider open-source community.

**Description:**
This talk will convey the findings of an upcoming paper on the influence of organizational structure on OSS projects and their contributor diversity. We found that internal organizational practices and policies can shape the level and nature of community engagement and influence project contributor diversity. We consider how organizations can leverage internal resources to cultivate a more diverse and inclusive open-source community. By addressing barriers to external contributors, building external communities, promoting mentorship programs, and fostering open discussions on community-oriented efforts, organizations can contribute to a more inclusive open-source ecosystem. Our findings highlight the importance of organizational involvement and proactive measures in shaping the diversity and inclusivity of open-source projects. Further research on open-source governance models and the implementation of these strategies will be valuable in promoting a more inclusive and accessible open-source community for all.
